‚úàÔ∏è SkyReserve Flight Booking System - Code Explanation
This Python script simulates a simple command-line flight booking system. It allows users to:

1. Search for available flights

2. Book a seat on a flight

3. View or cancel their bookings

üìÅ Data Structures
‚Ä¢ flights: A list of dictionaries. Each dictionary contains:

‚Ä¢ flight_no: Flight number (e.g., "FL001")

‚Ä¢ destination: Destination of the flight (e.g., "New York")

‚Ä¢ seats: A list of available seats (e.g., ["1A", "1B", "1C"])

‚Ä¢ bookings: An initially empty list where each new booking (passenger info, flight, seat) will be stored.

‚Ä¢ Allows the user to:

1. Choose a flight from the list.

2. Enter their name and contact.
